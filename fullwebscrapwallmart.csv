0,January 12 2014,13-May-21,Value for money,"I am so happy, finally, the general public has the ability to purchase cleaning products again. It was so difficult to buy them. The wipes are easy to take out. I used it for clean kids toys, doors, TV tables, counter tops in kitchen and bathrooms. Bonus point: kills COVID-19 VIRUS!",Average Rating:(5.0)out of 5 stars,Verified purchase
1,April 26 2020,23-Dec-20,Great Product!,"Love these! They last long in our vehicles even in the summer heat. To help prevent drying out and from them leaking since they have a lot of liquid in them, I place the container in a zip lock bag. They are thick. They do not tear easily, and I like the fabric type texture.",Average Rating:(1.0)out of 5 stars,Verified purchase
2,May 16 2020,10-Apr-21,Not really fit for shipping.,Product is great! only issue was either the packaging or delivery service since I ordered 2 packs one of them came soaked not sure If it open and spilled all over or of there was a hole.,Average Rating:(5.0)out of 5 stars,Verified purchase
3,July 27 2020,27-Dec-20,Open containers,All three containers leaked in transit. I use to use the 24/7 pre COVID. Now it is so hard to get them. They said I could refund or replace. I asked for replacement now they are out of stock.,Average Rating:(1.0)out of 5 stars,Verified purchase
4,July 29 2020,29-Jul-20,Damaged,"Of course I love the Clorox wipes. My problem is with  the way they arrived. 2 of the 3 containers were opened and leaking, causing the entire package to get wet. All of the labels were ripped off, literally just wrapped around the containers.","Average Rating:(5.0)out of 5 stars30341ratings, based on30341reviews",Verified purchase
5,August 3 2020,16-May-20,Awful,"I was so happy to find these in stock, finally, and be able to order them. I've ordered a lot of stuff from Walmart recently (usually I use mostly amazon). happy with everything so far -- but really disappointed. They have arrived looking like in the photo, two of the containers are dried out. How can all three have sprung a leak? The lids were on relatively securely.","Average Rating:(5.0)out of 5 stars30341ratings, based on30341reviews",Verified purchase
6,August 21 2020,12-Jan-14,Be Careful,"I ordered these because the price was right and I use these often. They arrived, and I took them out of the box. The next morning I took them out of the box and the fluid had spilt all over my counter tops and the labels were coming off and the blue ink dyed my hands and counter. I am diligently trying to get the counter tops cleared off and my fingers are still blue but getting lighter. I definitely would not order these again through the mail. I am very disappointed and all the labels have come off of the containers. Very poor service/quality.","Average Rating:(4.0)out of 5 stars30341ratings, based on30341reviews",Verified purchase
7,August 29 2020,21-Dec-20,Package NOT leak proof,I don't know why walmart keeps sending disinfectant any wipes that have clearly been opened. I had ordered baby ganics wipes awhile back and had to return them.

9,December 21 2020,17-Mar-21,Needs Better Shipping,lid of the middle container was cracked/broken.   Items were placed in the box on its side so liquid leaked all over the box and other containers.

10,December 23 2020,3-Sep-20,Need better Walmart shipping packaging.,Container not securely made for delivery. The liquid from wipes leaked in the box and inside of the package that contains the three. No inner protection from leaking on each individual container.

18,July 27 2021,27-Jul-20,,"I ordered 2 and it was 6 dollar shipping for each items. Considering that the wipes are hard to come by nowdays i had to order two and paid $12 in shipping. One came properly boxed up and with buble wraps and the other just on a plastic bag, it was open and squized to the poit that all the wipes were dry. I tried to return them but it was a pain to pack them and send it back in which it makes no sense sending a busted wipes. I gave one star for the delivery and not the item.","Average Rating:(2.0)out of 5 stars30341ratings, based on30341reviews",
19,July 28 2021,27-Jul-21,,all the liquid was drained out of all three containers and the paper was peeling off the sides of each of them by the time and took the outer plastic off.
